## 🎭 **Scenario Types & Dilemmas**

### **🔴 Impossible Choices**
These scenarios have no clear "right" answer:

**Example: The Mining Dilemma**
- **Accept $100M bribe** → Rich but reviled, environmental destruction
- **Reject offer** → Moral victory but continued unemployment  
- **Negotiate alternative** → Requires political skill, uncertain outcome
- **Hold referendum** → Democratic but transfers responsibility

### **⚡ Crisis Scenarios**
High-pressure situations requiring immediate decisions:

**Example: Student Deaths & Burning Buildings**
- **Deploy army** → Prevents property damage, causes more deaths
- **Allow burning** → Saves lives, looks weak, property destroyed
- **Personal intervention** → Heroic but dangerous leadership
- **Massive compensation** → Expensive but potentially healing

### **😂 Satirical Scenarios**
Absurd but realistic situations reflecting political absurdity:

**Example: Technology Yaks**
- **Choose yaks over WiFi** → Traditional but economically damaging
- **WiFi over yaks** → Modern but culturally destructive
- **Train technology yaks** → Creative solution, viral marketing success
- **Yak voting** → Absurd but great publicity
