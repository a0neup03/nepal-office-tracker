# ðŸŽ® Nepal Government Simulation Game - Complete Development Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ **Game Overview**

This is a sophisticated text-based simulation game that challenges players to navigate the complex political landscape of modern Nepal while adhering to constitutional principles. The game serves as both entertainment and educational tool about Nepal's governance challenges.

## ðŸ”§ **Advanced Game Mechanics**

### **Core Metrics System (0-100 scale):**
- **Political Stability**: Trust in institutions, government effectiveness
- **Economic Prosperity**: GDP growth, citizen wealth, employment 
- **Public Morale**: National unity, happiness, hope
- **Systemic Stress**: Hidden accumulation score (0-100) representing corruption, division, decay

### **Constitutional Framework (Rule of Law Mechanic):**
- Every choice flagged as `constitutional: true/false`
- Unconstitutional choices trigger severe penalties (-25 stability, +10 stress)
- Educational explanations reference Nepal Constitution 2015
- Visual warnings (red borders, warning icons) for unconstitutional options

### **Dynamic Event System:**
- Events selected based on current game state and prerequisites
- Tagged system (`economic`, `judiciary`, `foreign_policy`) for logical flow
- Historical context provided for each scenario

### **Crisis Trigger System:**
- **Stress Level 25+**: Public protests erupt
- **Stress Level 50+**: No-confidence motion filed  
- **Stress Level 75+**: Constitutional crisis declared

  "tags": ["category1", "category2"],
  "historical_context": "Reference to similar past event with analysis",
  "prerequisites": { 
    "min_stability": 0, 
    "max_stability": 100, 
    "required_turn": 1 
  },
  "choices": [
    {
      "text": "Choice description",
      "outcome": "Detailed consequence explanation", 
      "is_constitutional": true/false,
      "constitutional_implication": "Reference to specific constitutional articles/principles",
      "effects": {
